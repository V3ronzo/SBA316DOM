KBA, SBA, EASTER, WORK all in the same weekend! ! 
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

This SBA was better and felt like something i actually need to do/learn. Figured I'd just use a site im thinking of building as a reference. 
Conceptually , everything makes sense. Learning this is like learning Spanish . At least a lot of the ..'keyword(?) and native functions are called exactly the thing you want to do . It's just a lot of them. I can make a basic box with forms for user to submit and the busyness of this weekend warred heavily on my artistry. 
Nevertheless, we progress... even if slowly. 

This is the submission page for BoB's for my ''GreenBook'' Project. Simple .. I wanted a background with a collage buutttt my scratch disks are full and photoshop wouldn't open -____- -
